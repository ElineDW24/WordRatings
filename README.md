# WordRatings

In this project I analysed how people think of words in English and Dutch. I searched for the most positvly rated words, for correlations between ratings, for interesting patterns to visualise...
I also compared how words were percieved in Dutch and English. I found some interesting differences.

I used Python to complete this module. Specifically the modules pandas, numpy and seaborn get used here.

This project was done for my introductory course in Python.
